# Dose

> A Dependency Injection Container for Swift

## WORK IN PROGRESSSS

## ANY HELP WILL BE APPRECIATED

Coming from the PHP world, I used to develop with a lot of frameworks and concepts and one thing I like is the Dependendy Injection Container and Services system of [Symfony2](https://symfony.com/doc/current/book/service_container.html "Symfony2 Service Container")

I didn't find out amazing "simple" DIC online except Typhoon which is great but also big.
And I needed to play with Swift for a project.

Then here is Dose, a simple Dependency Injection Container clearly inspired by Symfony2 but also different and less powerful (at least for now)

## Purposes

The objective here is to bring a DIC into an iOS application.
All must stays simple, my goal was to avoid to always rely on the UIApplication delegate and always have plenty of singleton.

## Key features

* Easy to use
* Base on a configuration file
* Lazy loading of services
* All in Swift

## Installation

* TODO

## Usage

### Setting it up

#### A dose of a kernel

Yes, I called that the Kernel, firt you need to create it and to boostrap it.

The easiest way to get your Kernel available from where you want is to add a property on you application delegate

> Note that it is not required to do that. That is just the quickiest way.

```swift

    @UIApplicationMain class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
        var window: UIWindow?
        /// Your Kernel
        let kernel = Kernel()
        
        func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
        
            // Bootstrap your Kernel
            kernel.bootstrap()
            ....
            ....
        }
        
```

I would suggest to create your own Kernel by extending the Dose.Kernel


```swift

import Foundation
import Dose

class Kernel : Dose.Kernel {
    
    /**
    Sugar function to get the Kernel Instance
    Allow you to call Kernel.instance.get("service")
    */
    static var instance: Kernel {
        get {
            let appDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as! AppDelegate
            return appDelegate.kernel
        }
    }
}
```

> Doing that, you'll be able in the future to override the boostrap() method if necessary.


#### A dose of a definition

The definition file is where all the magic is set up. You need a simple Plist file that looks like:

```xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>parameters</key>
        <dict>
            <key>debug_output</key><true/>
            <key>lambdakey</key><string>A VALUE</string>
    </dict>
    <key>services</key>
    <dict>
        <key>dose.service1</key>
        <dict>
            <key>class</key><string>DoseTests.Service1</string>
            <key>arguments</key>
            <array>
                <string>@lambdakey</string>
                <string>An argument</string>
            </array>
        </dict>
        <key>dose.service2</key>
        <dict>
            <key>class</key><string>DoseTests.Service2</string>
            <key>arguments</key>
            <array>
                <string>Second Service</string>
                <string>@dose.service1</string>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</dict>
</plist>

```

> Find a bigger example here: 

##### A dose of a service

Each service:

* is define by an name. Ex:dose.service1
* needs a "class" to be instanciated. Ex:DoseTests.Service1
  
  Please note that you need to precise the Prefix, it's usually you application name but it could be a class from another module.

* can have several arguments.


##### A dose of an argument

The cool thing about argument is the "magic" character: "@".
Whith that you can refer to another service!

Then in the previous example, dose.service2 will have dose.service1 passed in argument in order to be instanciated.

> It works with the parameters too, because actually a parameter is not that much different than a service, one is a String or a Bool etc.. and the other is a Closure.

Amazing!

### Creating a service

Of course, it is always your responsability to create and develop you service, but he MUST extend of Dose.Service. He will receive an Array as arguments.
Here is an exemple:

```swift

    import Foundation
    import Dose

    class Service3 : Service {
        
        let name: String
        let logger: LoggerProtocol
        
        required init(args:[Any]) {
            name = args[1] as! String
            logger = args[0] as! LoggerProtocol
            super.init(args: args)
        }
    }
```

That's it, you are ready to go.

### Retrieve a service

Just call it: Kernel.instance.get("dose.service.name")

> Note that the call to a service trigger its instanciation.
